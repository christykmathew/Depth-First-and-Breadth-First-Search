Upload <i>sample.txt</i> containing the Graph nodes(start_node, end_node) and the costs.
``` python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
sample_text = open("/content/drive/My Drive/sample.txt")
```
<i>sample.txt</i> is format given below. The First Line is the number of nodes and edges and the second line is the start_node and the goal_node.
